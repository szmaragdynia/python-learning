# Repository for all things python
This repository serves as a container for different pythonese 'things'. I've choosen that "design" of a repository because I rarely use python.

"sensible_scripts" directory contains scripts that actually do something useful.

"code_lab" directory contains scripts in which I try out new concepts, experiment, learn, play with features and do different things to get a grasp of python.

As of July 2023 I am actually in the process of cleaning up this repo, especially I am cleaning up the gps-related scripts (merging files, further automation, more elegant solutions)
