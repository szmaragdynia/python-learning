A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#first ideas, maybe more opeartion heavy. Abandoned.
    #this does this(more-or-less):
    #number1 * number2; number1 * (number2-1); ...; number1 * (number2-step)
    #(number1-1) * number2; (number1-1) * (number2-1); ...; (number1-1) * (number2-step)
    #...
    #(number1-step) * number2; (number1-step) * (number2-1); ...; (number1-step) * (number2-step)
    #---
    #(number1-step) * (number2-step); (number1-step) * (number2-step-1); ...; (number1-step) * (number2-step-step)
    #etc
    #trying to make this semi-optimal xD
